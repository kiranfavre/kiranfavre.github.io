More background on this can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Texas_power_crisis).\n\nI will be estimating the number of homes in Houston that lost power due to these storms, and investigating if socioeconomic factors were predictors of community recovery from a power outage. To do so, I will be working with raster and vector data, and joining spatial data.\n\n## Data\n\n#### Night lights\n\nI will be using remotely-sensed data on night lights, gathered from the [Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_Infrared_Imaging_Radiometer_Suite), which is on the Suomi satellite. Specifically, I will be accessing the [VNP46A1](https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/missions-and-measurements/products/VNP46A1/) to detect the difference in night lights prior to and following the storms to identify areas that lost electricity due to the storms. I accessed the VIIRS data through NASA's [Level-1 and Atmospheric Archive & Distribution System Distributed Active Archive Center (LAADS DAAC)](https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/).\n\nI will be using data from February 7, 2021 and February 16, 2021. After exploring data on [NASA Worldview](https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/), these two dates have a low amount of cloud cover compared to surrounding dates, giving two clear, but contrasting imaged to understand the areas that experienced a power outage in Texas.\n\n#### Roads\n\nI used [Geofabrik's download sites](https://download.geofabrik.de/) to retrieve a shapefile of all highways in Texas and prepared a Geopackage (`.gpkg` file) containing just the subset of roads that intersect the Houston metropolitan area This is a third party company that redistributes OSM Data, as ingesting this data into a database where it can be subsetted and processed is a large undertaking. [OpenStreetMap (OSM)](https://planet.openstreetmap.org/) is a collaborative project which creates publicly available geographic data of the world and is where the original data is gathered.\n\n*Typically highways account for a large portion of the night lights observable from space (see Google's [Earth at Night](https://earth.google.com/web/@27.44405464,-84.7693044,206.63660162a,8916361.52264659d,35y,0h,0t,0r/data=CiQSIhIgMGY3ZTJkYzdlOGExMTFlNjk5MGQ2ZjgxOGQ2OWE2ZTc)). To minimize falsely identifying areas with reduced traffic as areas without power, I will be ignoring areas close to highways.*\n\n#### Houses\n\nOpenStreetMap also has building data. I again downloaded from Geofabrick and prepared a file containing only houses in the Houston metropolitan area.\n\n#### Socioeconomic\n\nSince I can't readily access all socioeconomic information for every home in the Houston area, I obtained data from the [U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs) for census tracts in 2019.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Spatial Analysis\n\n#### 1. Finding locations of blackouts\n\n##### Combining the data\n\nHere, I will start with loading in the appropriate packages and reading in the night light tiles I downloaded. Then, I will combine the tiles into a single object for each date (one before the storm, one after the storm).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(sf) #Support for simple features\nlibrary(stars) #Manipulating spatiotemporal arrays \nlibrary(dplyr) #Data manipulation\nlibrary(tmap) #map making\nlibrary(ggplot2) #plot making\nlibrary(here) #path construction\nlibrary(terra) #spatial analysis of vector data\n\n#read in night light tiles\nnightlights_pic1 <- read_stars(here(\"posts/2023-09-06-houston_spatial_analysis/data/VNP46A1/VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v05.001.2021039064328.tif\"))\n\nnightlights_pic2 <- read_stars(here(\"posts/2023-09-06-houston_spatial_analysis/data/VNP46A1/VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v06.001.2021039064329.tif\"))\n\nnightlights_pic3 <- read_stars(here(\"posts/2023-09-06-houston_spatial_analysis/data/VNP46A1/VNP46A1.A2021047.h08v05.001.2021048091106.tif\"))\n\nnightlights_pic4 <- read_stars(here(\"posts/2023-09-06-houston_spatial_analysis/data/VNP46A1/VNP46A1.A2021047.h08v06.001.2021048091105.tif\"))\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#combine into one stars object for each day\n\n#2021-02-07\nnight_tiles_2021_02_07 <- st_mosaic(nightlights_pic1, nightlights_pic2)\n\n#2021-02-16\nnight_tiles_2021_02_16 <- st_mosaic(nightlights_pic3, nightlights_pic4)\n```\n:::\n\n\n##### Creating a blackout mask\n\nMasking is a subsetting technique for spatial data. Creating a mask identifies cells with information I want to know, make that its own layer, and then can be applied to the other raster layer.\n\nI am finding the difference in intensity of night lights between the two dates I have spatial data for. I am making an assumption that the difference is caused by the storm. I have to reclassify the difference raster to create the mask, so I make an assumption that anywhere that had a difference of 200 nW cm^-2^sr^-1^ (unit of radiance) or more experienced a blackout. Then, I will assign `NA` all locations that experienced a difference of less than this threshold, since the difference is not great enough to indicate a power outage.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#find the change in night lights intensity caused by storm by subtracting the Feb 7 raster from Feb 16 raster\nintensity_diff <- night_tiles_2021_02_16 - night_tiles_2021_02_07\n\nplot(intensity_diff,\n     main = \"Change in night lights intensity due to storm\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n![Figure 1. First step in creating blackout mask is to find the difference in intensity of lights from before and after the storm.](1_difference_intensity.png)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#start by reclassifying intensity diff raster to recognize >200 as a blackout\nmask <- cut(intensity_diff, c(200, Inf), labels = c(\"Blackout\"))\n\n#reassign raster to assign NA to all locations of less than 200 n\nmask[mask < 200] = NA\n\n#blackout mask with <200 = NA and >200 = blackout\nplot(mask, breaks = \"equal\", col = \"black\") \n```\n:::\n\n\n![Figure 2. Blackout mask, where \\<200 nW cm^-2^sr^-1^ = NA and \\>200 nW cm^-2^sr^-1^ = blackout](2_VNP.png)\n\n##### Vectorize the mask\n\nNow, I will use `st_as_sf()` from the *sf* package to vectorize the blackout mask so I can continue working with the mask I made, ultimately being able to overlay it with other data and determine where the blackouts occurred. I also will use `st_make_valid` from the same package to fix any invalid geometries.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvector_mask <- st_as_sf(mask) |> #vectorize sf mask\n  st_make_valid() #fix invalid geoms\n\nplot(vector_mask)\n```\n:::\n\n\n![Figure 3. Vectorized blackout mask](3_mask.png)\n\n##### Cropping the vectorized map to our region of interest\n\nI am interest in the Houston Metropolitan area, and will be defining this area by the following coordinates:\n\n**(-96.5, 29), (-96.5, 30.5), (-94.5, 30.5), (-94.5, 29)**\n\nNow that I have the coordinates of interest, I will turn them into a polygon using `st_polygon` function from the *sf* package. A polygon is a set of discrete spatial points, composed of vertices of many spatial coordinates.\n\nThen, I will convert the polygon into a simple feature collection using `st_sfc()` and assign a coordinate reference system (CRS). I am assigning a CRS since the polygon's CRS must match that of the night lights data I downloaded if I want to join them. So, I will reproject the cropped blackout data to EPSG:3083 (NAD83 / Texas Centric Albers Equal Area).\n\nThen, I will spatially subset/crop the blackout mask I created to the Houston region I defined as a polygon.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# define coords \nne <- c(-94.5, 30.5) \nse <- c(-94.5, 29) \nsw <- c(-96.5, 29)\nnw <- c(-96.5, 30.5) \n\n# st_polygon input (since we can't just put these points in by themselves, input has to be a list) and we will make polygon of Houston using st_polygons\nhouston_boundary <- list(rbind(sw, nw, ne, se, sw))\n\n# polygon to represent Houston\nhouston_points <- st_polygon(x = houston_boundary, if (length(x)) \"XYZ\" else \"XY\")\n\n# Convert houston to a simple feature collection to feed in into st_crop\nhouston_sf <- st_sfc(houston_points, crs = 4326)\n\n# Crop the blackout mask to houston area\nblackout_cropped <- st_crop(vector_mask, houston_sf)\n\n# Reproject cropped blackout mask onto crs of interest (3083)\nreproj_houst_blackout <- st_transform(blackout_cropped, crs = 3083)\n\nplot(reproj_houst_blackout)\n```\n:::\n\n\n![Figure 4. Cropped blackout mask overlaid in Houston region](4_blackout_overlay.png)\n\n##### Excluding highways from blackout mask\n\nThe data I downloaded for the roads includes data on roads other than highways. So, to avoid reading in data I won't be using, I will take advantage of the `st_read` function's ability to subset using a SQL query.\n\nTo do so, I will start by defining a SQL query and load only the highway data using this query and `st_read`. I then have to reproject this data to the same CRS I used earlier (EPSG:3038).\n\nTo identify areas that are within 200 meters of all highways, I will use `st_buffer` that will compute a polygon that represents all points this range. This will allow me to find the areas that experienced blackouts that are further than 200 meters from a highway (to eliminate the lights produced by street lamps and other lights along highways that are detected).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#define a SQL query\nquery <- \"SELECT * FROM gis_osm_roads_free_1 WHERE fclass='motorway'\"\n\n#load highway data from geopackage  THIS PART NEEDS TO BE FIXED!!!!!!!!!!\nhighways <- st_read(\"C:/Users/kiran/Documents/MEDS 2022-2023/kiranfavre.github.io/posts/2023-09-06-houston_spatial_analysis/data/gis_osm_roads_free_1.gpkg\", query = query)\n\n#reproject to EPSG 3083\nreproj_highways <- st_transform(highways, crs = 3083)\n\n#identify areas within 200m of all highways\nhighway_buffers <- st_buffer(reproj_highways, dist = 200) |> \n  st_union()\n\n#identify areas that are further away than 200, from a highway that had a blackout\noutside_hwy_buffers <- st_disjoint(x = highway_buffers, y = reproj_houst_blackout) \n```\n:::\n\n\n#### 2. Finding homes impacted by blackouts\n\n##### Loading buildings data\n\nTo find homes impacted by blackouts, I will start by loading in the building dataset and use another SQL query to only select residential buildings. As I did with the earlier data, I will also reproject this data to the same CRS.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#make sql query for building data\nbldg_query <- \"SELECT * FROM gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1 WHERE type IS NULL AND name IS NULL OR type in ('residential', 'apartments', 'house', 'static_caravan', 'detached')\"\n\n#load in building data\nbuildings <- st_read(\"C:/Users/kiran/Documents/MEDS 2022-2023/kiranfavre.github.io/posts/2023-09-06-houston_spatial_analysis/data/gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1.gpkg\", query = bldg_query)\n\n#reproject building data ro crs EPSG:3083\nreproj_buildings <- st_transform(buildings, crs = 3083)\n```\n:::\n\n\n##### Finding homes in blackout areas\n\nNow, I will filter the data to homes within the blackout area by using the blackout mask I created and overlay that onto the data on Houston residential buildings, and count the number of impacted homes.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#use blackout mask, overlay onto houston homes\nblackout_homes <- st_join(reproj_houst_blackout, reproj_buildings)\n\n#filter houston with blackout mask\nnumber_blackout_homes <- blackout_homes |> \n  filter(fclass == \"building\") |>  #filtering for homes\n  summarize(count_blackout_homes = n())  #give number of homes that were impacted by blackout\n\n#number of homes in blackout area\nprint(paste0(\"There were \" ,number_blackout_homes$count_blackout_homes, \" homes in Houston that were impacted by the blackout\",\".\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n#### 3. Investigating socioeconomic factors\n\n##### Loading Census data\n\nI will again use `st_read()` to load the data, and separate the layers from the geodatabase into geometries and income data. I will select the median income field from this layer, and also reproject this data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#ACS geodatabase geomoetries\ntexas_geoms <- st_read(dsn = \"C:/Users/kiran/Documents/MEDS 2022-2023/kiranfavre.github.io/posts/2023-09-06-houston_spatial_analysis/data/ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48_TEXAS.gdb\",\n                       layer = \"ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48_TEXAS\")\n\n#read in income layer from geometries\nincome_data <- st_read(dsn = \"C:/Users/kiran/Documents/MEDS 2022-2023/kiranfavre.github.io/posts/2023-09-06-houston_spatial_analysis/data/ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48_TEXAS.gdb\",\n                       layer = \"X19_INCOME\")\n\n#select median income field from income layer\nmedian_income <- income_data |> \n  select('GEOID','B19013e1') \n\n#reproj texas geomms\nreproj_tx_geoms <- st_transform(texas_geoms, crs = 3083)\n```\n:::\n\n\n##### Determining which census tracts experienced blackouts\n\nNow, I will join the income data to the census tract geometries by geometry ID, and spatially join census tract data with buildings determined to be impacted by blackouts to find which census tracts had blackouts.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#want to join all of both data sets by GEOMID, so using a left join\njoined_income_census <- left_join(reproj_tx_geoms, median_income, by = c(\"GEOID_Data\" = \"GEOID\")) \n\n#spatially join tx census data with buildings impacted by blackouts\nblackout_bldgs_census <- st_join(blackout_homes,joined_income_census)\n\n#determine which census tracts were impacted by the blackout\nblackout_tracts <- blackout_bldgs_census |> \n  group_by(TRACTCE) |> \n  summarize(B19013e1 = n()) \n#just has tract id, median income, and associated geometries\n```\n:::\n\n\n##### Comparison of incomes of impacted tracts to unimpacted tracts\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#median income by tract, \njoined_median_income_census <- joined_income_census |> group_by(TRACTCE, B19013e1)|>\n  summarize()\n#just has tract id, median income, and associated geometries\n\n#map of median income homes by census tract that experienced blackouts\ntm_shape(houston_sf) + tm_polygons(col = \"white\") +\n  tm_shape(joined_median_income_census) +\n  tm_polygons(col = \"white\") +\n  tm_shape(blackout_tracts) +\n  tm_polygons(col = \"blue\") +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Median Income Homes in Houston Impacted by Blackouts\", title.size = 0.1)  ##FIX THIS!\n```\n:::\n\n\n![Figure 5.

However, the distribution of income in impacted areas and non impacted areas are very similar (both being skewed to the right). Limitations of this study could include non-response bias with the Census data or could have used differing sizes for the highway buffers. People could have not responded to Census data collection, or families could have impacted the intensity of light coming from their home depending if they were there or not the days the images were collected.\n",
