This repository is for our tutorial for using data from the [Global Biodiversity Information Facilitiy (GBIF)](https://www.gbif.org/). In collaboration with classmates Jillian Allison and Erica Bishop, we will be using an occurrence dataset about [iNaturalist Research Grade Observations](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/50c9509d-22c7-4a22-a47d-8c48425ef4a7). This blog will include an installation guide to get started using GBIF.

This repository includes a Jupyter Notebook with the tutorial for EDS 220 Working With Environmental Data at UC Santa Barbara (Fall 2021 quarter).
