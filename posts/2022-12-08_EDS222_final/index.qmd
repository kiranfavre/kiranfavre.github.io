## **MOTIVATION**

Coastal erosion is a natural process of sediment removal that occurs due to storms and waves. Climate change has caused sea levels to rise, increasing concerns for possible effects on the coastlines. While this is a natural process, some coastal communities could be facing more coastal erosion than others considering the level of development along the coast. As of 2015, approximately [68% (26.3 million people](https://coast.noaa.gov/states/california.html)) of California residents live in a coastal area ([within approximately half a mile of the mean high water line](https://coast.noaa.gov/czm/mystate/#:~:text=The%20California%20coastal%20zone%20generally,line%20of%20highest%20tidal%20action.)) and have likely witnessed some level of coastal erosion. California's coastlines are also susceptible to coastal erosion due to its tectonic activity and exposure to extreme weather events such as ENSO.

Efforts to mitigate and adapt to erosion along the coastline have been made with increasing concern for displacement of communities and safety. [The Department of Boating & Waterways ](https://dbw.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=28766) is responsible for responding to coastal erosion in California. In areas in need of attention, such as where roads or homes collapse off of cliff tops or beach front properties being flooded, there are different levels of responses depending on the intensity of erosion. Sand replenishment and seawall or jetty installation are currently used to maintain the current infrastructure along the coastlines. This type of analysis can help in evaluating areas that need different solutions depending on the level of shoreline change.

## **DATA**

The data used for this analysis was produced by Coastal and Marine Hazards and Resources Program with the United States Geological Survey. This data is publicly available through the [USGS ScienceBase-Catalog](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/) through a data release from the Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center. The spatial range spans the California coast, given in Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates and degrees latitude and longitude. California is broken into three regions: Northern, Central, and Southern. 

[The dataset](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5f9317c482ce720ee2d5970c) I used includes shoreline change data along the coast of California from 2015-2016. Net shoreline movement, in meters, serves as the metric of shoreline change. This data was compiled to observe changes in the shoreline in response to extreme weather, as it was collected during an El Niño event (2015 marking \'before an El Niño\' and 2016 marking \'after an El Niño\'). Net shoreline movement was \'calculated at a transect spacing of 50 meters as a proxy for sandy shoreline change throughout the El Nino winter season \[\^1\].

One limitation to this data is the assumption of a constant operational mean high water among regions in California that varied by region, but not within the regions themselves. Another limitation is that I am using observations derived from USGS\'s DSAS and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) digital elevation models (DEMs), where these may have used their own assumptions that could introduce bias into this data set. Another limitation is the unequal distribution of observations per region: Southern California has many more observations than Northern or Central California, so an analysis on Southern California may be more representative of the population than the other regions.

To explore the data, I made histograms to understand the distribution of net shoreline movement in each region of California. The data is approximately normally distributed in all of California, with the most normal distribution in Southern California.

### ANALYSIS

I will begin with hypothesis testing to determine whether the mean net shoreline movement is the same in each region.

$$
H_0:\mu_{Norcal} - \mu_{Cencal} - \mu_{Socal} = 0$$

$$
 H_1: \mu_{Norcal} - \mu_{Cencal} - \mu_{Socal} \neq 0 
$$

I calculated the average of each region, and found that the average net shoreline movement is greatest in Central California and least in Southern California. A positive value for net shoreline movement indicates an extending coastline, where a negative value indicates erosion, so the most negative values here indicate more erosion.

To determine if there is a relationship between location along the coast and net shoreline movement, I chose to break California into its three study regions: Northern, Central, and Southern. I began with running a multiple linear regression of the impact of location on net shoreline movement. Using the equation:

$$NSM =\beta_{0}+\beta_{1} \cdot Longitude +\beta_{2} \cdot \text Latitude+\varepsilon_i$$
I broke the data into the regions, and used this model for each region. Using RStudio, I was able to calculate the values for the coefficients, listed below.

## **FUTURE RESEARCH**

More monitoring of this coastline will be essential in forming helpful policy and adaptation strategies. Along with the data collection itself, the model used here could be improved in the future to account for discrepancies here. Another analysis that could be helpful in answering this question would be a time series decomposition analysis. This data did not have time observations, rather metrics already calculated based on the time interval provided. These models can also be applied to other areas in the United States or globally that are facing similar problems. 

West Coast could improve modeling and understanding of coastal change (allude back to earlier paragraph, can use link at the end of paragraph 2 to beef this up). [This recent study](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/news/new-high-resolution-study-california-coastal-cliff-erosion-released) inspired me to look further into coastal erosion in California. With how dynamic the shoreline is in lieu of natural processes, in addition to anthropogenic influences, it is important to improve the understanding of how the coastline is changing. The effects of climate change are being understood as they happen.
