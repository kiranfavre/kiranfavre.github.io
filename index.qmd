### Hi!

I'm Kiran, and I am currently a graduate student at the Bren School for Environmental Science & Management at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I am currently working on a capstone project with a group to create an application that automates our client's data entry workflow and a data visualization application. I am interested in climate change, science communication, and marine conservation.
